# Plan Workflow

## Purpose

Break down complex tasks into manageable steps with clear deliverables and checkpoints.

## Process

### Step 1: Define Scope

- What exactly needs to be built?
- What is out of scope?
- What are the acceptance criteria?

### Step 2: Identify Components

- Break into logical parts
- Identify dependencies
- Note reusable elements

### Step 3: Sequence Tasks

- Order by dependencies
- Identify parallel work
- Mark critical path

### Step 4: Estimate Effort

- Size each task (S/M/L)
- Identify risks
- Add buffer for unknowns

### Step 5: Create Plan

- Write step-by-step instructions
- Add approval checkpoints
- Define done criteria
