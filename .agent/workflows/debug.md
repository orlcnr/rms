# Debug Workflow

## Purpose

Systematically identify, analyze, and fix bugs with proper verification.

## Process

### Step 1: Reproduce

- Get exact steps to reproduce
- Identify environment details
- Note expected vs actual behavior

### Step 2: Isolate

- When did it start happening?
- What changed recently?
- Does it happen consistently?

### Step 3: Investigate

- Check error messages
- Review relevant logs
- Trace code execution
- Identify suspects

### Step 4: Hypothesize

- Form theory about cause
- Predict what fix should change
- Consider side effects

### Step 5: Fix

- Implement minimal fix
- Avoid unnecessary changes
- Document the fix

### Step 6: Verify

- Confirm original issue fixed
- Check for regressions
- Test edge cases

### Step 7: Prevent

- Add test for this case
- Consider similar bugs
- Update documentation if needed
