# Enhance Workflow

## Purpose

Systematically improve existing code without changing functionality.

## Process

### Step 1: Understand

- What does this code do?
- Why does it exist?
- What are its dependencies?

### Step 2: Identify Issues

- Code smells
- Performance problems
- Maintainability concerns
- Missing tests

### Step 3: Plan Changes

- List improvements
- Prioritize by impact
- Ensure safe refactoring

### Step 4: Implement

- One change at a time
- Verify after each change
- Keep commits focused

### Step 5: Verify

- Tests still pass
- Behavior unchanged
- Performance acceptable

## Output Format
